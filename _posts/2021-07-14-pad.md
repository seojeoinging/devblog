I'm back at my parents' house for the summer break. While watching TV with my family, we came across some news about my favorite Korean comedian, Jae Seok-yu, who donated another 50 million won to support underprivileged teenage girls. He's known for frequently donating hundreds of millions of won to assist underprivileged teenage girls, single mothers, and multicultural families.

What really struck us was the story that these girls couldn't afford sanitary pads and were using shoe insoles as substitutes. It's a situation none of us had ever imagined. We were all really taken aback by that news. It just goes to show how impactful even a small act of kindness can be.

My mom shared more details about this, and it turns out it's not just in Korea. Poor women in places like Tanzania in Africa also struggle to access sanitary pads. In fact, many teenage girls in Africa don't even have menstruation products. This means they can't go to school during their periods and often can't leave their homes.

They have to resort to using things like cloth, sponges, mattress scraps, leaves, and even paper to manage their periods. Some of them have never even seen a proper sanitary pad. Shockingly, in Tanzania, which has it the toughest, 48% of teenage girls have to miss school when they're on their period. That's about 60 days or two whole months every year!

Not only does this affect their right to an education, but it also puts their health at risk. Using unsanitary alternatives can lead to infections like vaginitis and urinary tract infections. It's a tough situation they're facing.

I had a little chat with my mom and my twin sister, Grace, about how we can help. They suggested menstrual cups as a solution, but I was unsure because I've never used one, and I don't know much about it. However, my family decided to purchase a bunch of menstrual cups and distribute them to the young women in need around us.

At first, it's like a little gift, but I don't think it's a complete solution. I wonder, what's the help coming from those big global companies that sell loads of sanitary pads and menstrual cups? It got me thinking.

I'm going to keep exploring this area, and my mom, being a strong supporter, is right there with me. We're determined to make a difference.
