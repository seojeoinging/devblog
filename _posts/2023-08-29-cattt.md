- I first noticed this humanoid robot, “Ameca”, early last year. I was completely surprised by the advanced humanoid robot technology at that time, and uploaded it to my personal blog.
- In a video released on their YouTube Channel on June 29, 2023, Ameca is being asked to make a drawing of a cat. Previously, Engineered Arts have demonstrated Ameca's ability to express many different kinds of human emotions and their ability to speak in multiple languages.

In April 2023, Engineered Arts upgraded their software by training them on GPT-4, after which the researchers found that they were slower and less responsive. Now, researchers have used Stable Diffusion to give Ameca 'the power to imagine drawings.

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released by Stability AI in August 2022. It is primarily used to create detailed images based on text descriptions. But it can also perform tasks like outpainting, inpainting, and generating image-to-image translations based on text prompts.
