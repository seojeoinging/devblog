My mom and I have been diving into the world of technology for new menstrual cups since the beginning of this year, with the goal of creating ones that can offer biometric information while being semi-permanent. Because my study location and her place are quite a distance apart, we often hop on video calls to swap research findings and chat about our thoughts.

As you know, she has been doing most of the reading and research because she's more knowledgeable. She seems to be driven to create a semi-permanent menstrual cup for girls in economically disadvantaged and vulnerable situations, rather than relying on disposable sanitary pads. This summer vacation, as I visited my parents' house, I had the opportunity to collaborate with her in earnest.

During my global internship that I've been engaged in since the beginning of this year, I've picked up some data science skills and gained a basic understanding of the open-source RStudio platform. I decided to put these skills to work for the big data analysis she's been wanting to do. We've made the decision to develop a new smart menstrual cup technology that we're passionate about and apply for a patent this time.

Of course, this will be an unfamiliar and quite challenging endeavor for me. But, as I mentioned, I'm eager to dive in and learn from helping her. Moreover, during this vacation, I can do more research and test the things that piqued my interest. It's a valuable opportunity.

It's essentially a process of experimenting with my ideas and bringing them to life through technical challenges and diverse experiences. I'm looking forward to working alongside my mom. With over 20 years of experience at a global corporation, she has a wealth of skills to impart, and together, we'll make it happen.

 This time, I researched data on the global women's product market (symboles, menstrual cups, tampons, others) and technology.

I mainly googled, and I went to Amazon to investigate reviews of menstrual cups. It was really interesting to read reviews from actual buyers on the Amazon site. And it was interesting as if I became an employee who sells menstrual cups and plans products in a company.
On the Amazon site, a lot of purchasing data from buyers was piled up with reviews.
If I get into college and learn statistics later, I decided to make good use of this.

1. In the R studio program, several keywords discussed with my team member mom were entered.
2. We had a long discussion to derive this keyword.
 To be honest, I didn't understand smart technology and technology for sensing biometric information well. This part was quite difficult, but my team leader, my mom, explained it well in an easy way to understand. Just as pedestrians cross the street when they see a red light, they say that sensors attached to menstrual cups will intuitively transmit various information to us through a medium called a smartphone. Through them, we can analyze various data and take action in real time.
3. I was only able to successfully draw the Data Mining field with Pilot using R Studio' program.
It was very helpful because I could learn only the parts I needed without difficulty using YouTube Clip where I could learn R Studio.
4. It was a field with no correct answer, so I was 100% satisfied with the result.
