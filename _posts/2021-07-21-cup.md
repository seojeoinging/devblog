I came back to my parents' house during the summer vacation.
While watching TV with my family, I came across the news that my favorite Korean comedian, Jae Seok-yu, donated another W50 million to poor female teenagers.
He is said to have often donated hundreds of millions of won to poor female teenagers, single mothers, and multicultural families. In particular, he was shocked by the news that poor female teenagers were unable to buy sanitary sanitary sanitary pads because they did not have money, so he donated because he was shocked by the news that he used shoe insoles instead. Replacing it with shoe insoles because you couldn't buy sanitary pads? My family and I were also very shocked. It's a story I never normally imagined.

My mom gave me additional information about this.
 It is said that not only poor female teenagers in Korea but also women in poor Africa such as Tanzania are not receiving sanitary pads. Also, many female teenagers in Africa do not have menstruation, so they cannot go to school during menstruation and go out at all.
They are using a cloth, sponge, piece of mattress, leaf, paper, and more to cover their body. There are even women who have never seen sanitary pads. Among them, 48% of female adolescents in Tanzania, the worst, are forced to stay home without going to school during their periods. Since they are absent for about 60 days (two months) on the 5th of each month, these female teenagers are not only infringed on their right to study, but they are also easily exposed to infectious diseases such as vaginitis and urinary tract infections by using unsanitary items as sanitary pads, threatening their health.

I had a little discussion with my mother and my twin sister Grace. How can we help them? hey offered a menstrual cup as a solution, but I don't know.Because I've never used a menstrual cup and I don't know much about it...
My family bought a bunch of menstrual cups and gave them to poor young women around me.

First of all, I can give it away as a gift, but I don't think it can be a fundamental solution. What help is being offered by a global big company that sells Dodecce sanitary pads or menstrual cups? I suddenly had a lot of thoughts. I will also continue to be interested in this area. As the same woman, my mother decided to continue to worry and help me. She is a strong supporter of me.

#### Pros of menstrual cups

- It can be used for up to 10 years unless it is properly managed and lost. However and is recommended to replace it every two to three years for your health.
- Menstrual cups can be used for up to 12 hours, but for safety reasons and is recommended to replace them every 2-3 hours.

#### Con of menstrual cups

- Side effects of menstrual cups include "endometriosis, pelvic organ dislocation, cystitis, etc." And there is a hassle of cleaning.
