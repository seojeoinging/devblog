Recently, I have been worried about my career path as I aim to enter college.
As my family & friends knows, I have been interested in statistics or data science majors for many years.
 So since 2~3 years ago, I searched for some books related to statistics and read it from time to time.
Also, I’m very interested in data science major.

- I asked a lot of questions to my parents having lots of professional experience and knowledge in that field.
     In addition to, my uncle, a doctor in that fields, I keep asking for various information.
- However, there are still several questions. “Is this a field that I really want to study? And is it an area I can do well? Another important point to consider is this. If I major in statistics, will I be able to get a stable job in the future?
- So I tried Googling again about statistics major and job.
- I have to try to join the university soon. Now is the time for me to review a lot of things carefully. Lol
