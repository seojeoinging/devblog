My birthday is August 11th. Strictly speaking, it's my & my twin sister Grace's birthday. In my parents' words, Grace and I were born twins by the grace of God.

She is suah a amazing sister and has so many talents. She goes to high school with me in Pennsylvania and is trying to go to Art schoolnext year.

Sometimes I feel sorry to have to share my birthday with her(lol), but I'm so grateful and happy to have her by my side all the time. She'll be my best friend forever.!!

Me and Her are staying at my parents' house during summer vacation.
I'm so thankful to my family gathered and spent our birthday party happily together.

 ( and also To God and my parents who made me born in the world.
