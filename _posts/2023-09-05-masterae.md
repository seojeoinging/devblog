I developed Idea, which I had been exchanging with my mom since last fall, and applied for a patent by incubating for about a year and a half.

- Since my mom and I are far away, we often have ideas through video calls exchanged with. My mom taught me related skills, and Tech. I have searched related information. I also recorded these activities on my personal blog.
- We've had dozens of discussions in the meantime.
- I came to my parents' house every summer vacation and had a face-to-face discussion and workshop with her. In particular,
  I searched mainly for technical things and analyzed big data based on my global internship experience.
- We have completed the challenge of applying for this patent with One team. I'm so proud of myself.
- I will study this patent more after I enter university. In connection with my major, of course..
