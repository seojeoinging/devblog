Last summer, I mentioned that I've been consistently donating a portion of my monthly allowance through the NGO organization called Good Neighbors for the past nine years. It might not be a large sum, but I take pride in the fact that my modest allowance is making a significant difference in someone's life, providing support and encouragement. I'm gonna keep persue this support haha.

By the way, I'd like to introduce Good Neighbors once again. If you happen to read this post again, I'd like to suggest that you to join this community.

Starting in April this year, I began to support a young girl in Ethiopia with a monthly donation of 30,000 Korean won, which is roughly around $30 USD. It might not seem like a lot, but for me, it's a significant amount.

Every month, when I receive Good Neighbors' newsletters, I come across heart-wrenching stories about the rights of children in various countries, including Ethiopia and Africa. That was the reason that prompted me to make this decision. The child I'm supporting, Kidist, is a kind, caring, and beautiful girl, and she's five years younger than me. With my monthly donation, she now has the means to get quality school supplies, attend school, and study in a clean classroom.

I so proud that I'm the one of the many hands that are supporting her to dream about a brighter future. I believe that she will remember me someday and make her future even brighter.
