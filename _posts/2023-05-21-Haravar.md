      - About this course
     This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for m ajors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.  
 I am very satisfied to be able to share these useful and famous lectures as an open source.

I can't believe that a young high school student like me can study difficult content through this advanced lecture video just with my laptop. That’s a dope!!!  It's not restricted by time and place at all.
Thanks to these informative lecture clips, this generation of people seems to be getting smarter.
