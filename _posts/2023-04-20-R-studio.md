Hey yall!

Recently, while discussing my college major, I ended up having a conversation with my mom about data analysis. She provided a simple explanation of R Studio, a program she uses for big data analysis in her organization. She mentioned that, regardless of not being a professional software engineer, anyone can analyze vast amounts of big data through open-source software like this. She also told me that she's currently using these open-source tools in her work, having bought a book to assist her, but to be honest, I find it quite challenging myself.

I was simply curious, so I did some more Googling about the R language.

- R is a free software designed to make it easy to perform complex calculations and visualization techniques used in the process of statistical analysis

Here's the link
[R-Language](https://www.r-project.org/)

- It is used a lot in matrix calculations and shows excellent performance and is open-source and can produce and download packages, so it can expand many functions and has excellent visualization.
- The history of R begins with the statistical programming language **S**. **S** was developed by the AT&T Bell Institute in 1976 with the goal of "to turnideas into software, quick and fast".
- Bell Labs tried to adopt a single alphabet for the name of a language, and so was S and R, and so was the C language at that time.
- In 1988, object concepts were introduced into S's grammatical structure or language. So even though the book was published under the name of "New S", it's not one letter - they have a lot of worries about the name. - In the meantime, R was developed by Ross Inaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1993.
- It was another S-language program that introduced the concept of static scope from the language Scheme.
- In 1995, when R was 2 years old, it was released for free under a GPL license.
- The latest version of S required most of the existing code to be newly written, but in the case of R, the existing S code was still available, and it was compiled and expanded to work on most UNIX-affiliated platforms.

**The top left is a UI that can be executed by entering a source, and the Console is at the bottom, so you can enter commands. If you type help(c), you can see a description of c(Concentration) at the bottom right. Several windows are grouped into tabs, so you can get used to them quickly.**

- Usually, you code one line and press Ctrl+Enter Key to run the current line and move on to the next line. And you can code multiple lines at once, or drag and select the part of the previous code you want to execute, and then press Run to execute that part only. The Console then informs you of the result along with the command.

- There are Rstudio training clips for beginners like me on YouTube, so it's very helpful for you to refer to.
