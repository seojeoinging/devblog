#### sharing "Learn Python in 1 Hour" Beginners

I took AP stat last year, and I prepared for that course over summer. I think AP stat is a valuable course to take for those who are planning to major in Statistics / Data Science. In AP stat, you learn a statistical concepts and skills and understanding of data analysis.

Over summer, I found a very useful clip that can teach the basics of Python, one of the fundamental tools in data science. You can learn pyton in open-source like youtube clips making accessible for beginners to learn through tutorials like this. You can use this clip as a reference if you are planning to prepare for Ap stat or studying for it.
