Publisher: HarperPerennial; 1st edition (January 1, 1993)

- “This book looks at statistics that are often used to judge or decide on various things closely related to our lives. In the first chapter, referring to the data to be introduced, a good schematic of the data is called art and science. The core of these data is to collect and analyze the raw data, and based on this, it informs the certain types and forms hidden in the pile of numbers. Next, in probability and statistical reasoning, the basic principles and methods used in statistics such as standard deviation, sampling, sampling size, and hypothesis verification are explained in various formulas and schematics.”

- “The Cartoon Guide to Statistics covers all the central ideas of modern statistics: the summary and display of
       data, probability in gambling and medicine, random variables, Bernoulli Trails, the Central Limit Theorem,
       hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and much more?all explained in simple, clear, and yes,
       funny illustrations. Never again will you order the Poisson Distribution in a French restaurant!"

I appreciated how the book simplified daunting statistical ideas, from probability to hypothesis testing, making them easy to understand. It also made me realize the practical applications of statistics in various fields, from science to social studies, and how it plays a significant role in decision-making.
