"Everything you can imagine is real." These words by Pablo Picasso are like a beacon of light, especially during those moments of stress and uncertainty that come with school and college applications.

When you're in the midst of exams, deadlines, and a whirlwind of decisions, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. You might question your abilities, your choices, and wonder if you'll ever reach your goals. But this quote reminds you that the power of imagination is your secret weapon.

Think about it. Every great invention, every masterpiece, and every incredible achievement started as a simple thought, a spark of imagination. It's a testament to the limitless potential that lies within you.

Picasso's words encourage me to believe in myself and the visions I hold. They remind me that the journey I'm on, with all its ups and downs, is a canvas waiting for my unique brushstrokes. My dreams are not just figments of my imagination; they can become real if I keep moving forward, one step at a time.

Embrace the challenges and the stress as part of your path towards realizing those dreams. Remember, every great work of art, including your own life story, is shaped through dedication, resilience, and the power of imagination. You've got this, and your dreams are very much within your reach.

Love.
